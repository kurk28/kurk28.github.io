      <h2 class="heading-section">I Work Best</h2>
      <p>I primarily prefer remote work, occasionally visiting the office. A quiet environment helps me stay focused.
      </p>
      <p>I'm most productive in flexible work environments that trust me to manage my time effectively.</p>
      <p>Understanding the "why" behind a task is crucial for my engagement and helps ensure the solution truly meets
        the need.</p>
      <p>I thrive when I know where to find all necessary tools and documentation for my work</p>
      <p>Structured environments with clear goals help me leverage my ability to deep-dive and hyperfocus effectively.
      </p>
      <p>I deliver my best work when I can focus deeply on one core task at a time.</p>
      <p>A structured workspace helps me focus. MacBook and additional 16" monitor from <a class="link"

          target="_blank">Arzopa</a> help me stay organized and efficient.</p>
      <p>When focused, I mute notifications and often use focus-enhancing sounds (Pink Noise, etc.). If my headphones
        are on, I'm likely in deep work mode; messaging is the best way to reach me, and I'll respond as soon as I can
        pause.</p>
      <h2 class="heading-section">Communication</h2>
      <p>I find asynchronous communication (like Slack messages or emails) highly efficient for thoughtful responses and
        focused work. I'm readily available for synchronous calls when needed for collaboration or urgent matters.
        Please consider messaging me briefly before calling so I can prepare.</p>
      <p>I prefer having my camera on during video calls and appreciate it if you do too.</p>
      <p>My native language is Russian, so my English may sound direct. I value clarity and appreciate your
        understanding as I continuously refine my fluency.</p>
      <p>I might be quiet during small talk, but I genuinely enjoy engaging in meaningful discussions.</p>
      <p>I maintain clear work-life boundaries to ensure I'm focused and recharged.</p>
      <h2 class="heading-section">How To Help Me Succeed</h2>
      <p>I appreciate planned meetings with clear agendas for focused discussions, but I understand urgent matters arise
        and am flexible when needed. Short, focused meetings tend to be most productive for me.</p>
      <p>Breaking down larger tasks into smaller steps with clear deadlines works great for me and helps ensure timely
        progress and delivery.</p>
      <p>I'm a visual thinker. If we're discussing complex ideas, drawing them out (e.g., using <a class="link"
          href="https://excalidraw.com/" target="_blank"></a>) can be very helpful.</p>
      <p>Feel free to stop me if I occasionally dive too deep into details during a discussion.</p>
      <p>Regular feedback is invaluable for my growth. Whether it's a quick Slack message or a 1-on-1, specific examples
        of what's working well or how I could approach something differently are very helpful. <br> Don't forget to
        compliment me if I'm doing right. Knowing I'm on the right track is a great motivator
        <span class="emoji">☺️</span>
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-section">I Value</h2>
      <p>Openness. I love sharing knowledge and learning from others.</p>
      <p>Honestly. I believe in straightforward, respectful communication, even when discussing challenges.</p>
      <p>Reliability. I may make mistake, like misjudging deadlines, but I always aim to deliver on my commitments.</p>
      <p>Time. We all have limited time, so let's use it wisely.</p>
      <h2 class="heading-section">A Little Bit More About Me</h2>
      <p>I tend to be pedantic and consistent in my approach to work.</p>
      <p>I enjoy solving problems, especially complex ones.</p>
      <p>Taking a proper lunch break is important for my daily rhythm.</p>
      <p>I'm always interested in hearing stories and perspectives from others.</p>
      <p>I connect deeply with tasks and people and strive to be supportive of those around me.</p>
